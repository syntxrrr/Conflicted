Part 1
The protagonist is said to be the center of the story, the hero, the main character.<br>

The antagonist is said to be the enemy, the one that get's in the way of the hero.<br>

After discovering the messed up truth, I wonder, which one am I...?

It all started... At my house... I was just researching about the projects done in PCBs. You see, I've been getting into microcontrollers and electronics, and applying code to them, as a neat hobby.

I then heard a feminine loud high-pitched voice, a yell "Hello, may I call upon Syne Nomine?"

(... Syne Nomine... Me? I wonder what could that be?)

I looked like a slob back then, but that's because I was. I mean, How could I not be? I was immersed in gazing upon my beloved laptop and our embedded kids. At least I always take a bath first thing in the morning... Well, enough justification. I stared outside of the window, and saw a woman in a black suit and red tie, you know, the typical businessy type person, probably trying to sell something, that's what I thought back then.

(... But wow, she's rather... beautiful in *their* standards, she has the smile and eyes that could do the talking for her and make anyone believe it without doubt. I would... If I cared)

I changed my clothes and wore my favorite slippers, I went outside and -- well, I always have an impulse whenever I interact with women -- actually with anyone, but of course, it's worse on girls and women -- I, usually having a baritone voice, spoke in a stuttering countertenor voice, as my voice keeps cracking, words come out "Y-y-yes... I-I am Nomi-Syne! Um... w-wait, w-what-do you-"

"Don't worry, may my smile soothe you for now. No need to be anxious." She flashed her smile with her eyes closed, I close my eyes as my face turns red like tomato, trying to hide my uncontrollable smile. These types of girls and women are... scary.

(S-Sorry, but your appeal makes it hard for me to talk to you...!) I gulped and left a smile, damn it.

"Let's get to the point. I am the Lina, the student hunter. I came here on behalf of the University of Existence, to inform you that you've been selected as a student for the First year, class 385th, we've been observing you for a few months, and you've been in your room most of the time, enhancing your well-rounded talents."

"Huh?! A new student? University of Existence? Observing me??? But that would mean-" I was surprised, started sweating cold bullets. For... many reasons.

"Yeah... There aren't really many guys who could do *that* many times, but let's move on hahaha. I see you have your questions, but please feel free to refer to this handbook." She blushed in embarassment, but smiled, throwing the embarassing truth aside.

"About the medium of our observation, it terminated the moment I arrived, so you don't have any evidence to present, when you feel like reporting us. Also... Your CCTV cameras are being altered as we speak and your voice recorder could be denied easily." She stuck her tounge against me, like a child.

"Anyway, we need your kind of talent, and you need our kind of resources, right? Let's benefit each other in the way that will better the world! Allow me to be the first to welcome you, as a new student, if ever you hopefully, decided to join us. Well, farewell for now. I'm off to looking for the next student", Ms. Lina said, flashed her smile, and bid her farewell.

Part 2

Date and Time: August 1, 2016; ? Morning
Place: University of Existence, Gate 1 Entrance

Let's fast forward to my first day as a student of UoE -- as I would like to call it. I am taking a program under Electronics Engineering and Computational Science. These course doesn't have a major -- rather, everything there is treated like one.

I really wasn't suppose to come, even though they promised free tuition and guaranteed that I'll be catered to my needs as long as I provide contribution to the campus. It's suspicious, it's too convenient, and if life ever taught me something in the past, that's there are always misery within happiness, there's a lie in believe. 

But of course, they used my undying love for computers and electronics against me. As the gate opens, the smile that I've been
trying to hide is inevitably showing, I shiver in excitement as I remember the words I read in that damned handbook.

"In order to graduate, a student must submit 4 - 10 contributions to the university and the world, depending on the program they undertook. One contribution in equivalent to one year as a student of UoE, failure to submit a contribution, the university will demand
you to pay a fee equivalent to one year of tuition."

"Students will have their own room consisting of a bathroom, a bedroom, a closet, a portfolio room, and their own laboratory, it's up to the students how the laboratory should look like or should contain, they're free to request for certain facilities, paraphernelia and their own resources that will aid to their contributions".

"The University makes sure its technologies and facilities are state of the art, and lives up to it's name containing anything that could be learned in order to better the humanity and clear the irrational misconceptions over controversial topics."

There are a lot more, but that's not important right now! This must be my dream university! Inside the campus is beautiful, it makes
the university prestigious and novel, the faint smell of flowers and plantations, the serene sleeping animals that roam the university
along with the students. It's like the garden of eden, it's early so there aren't that many people here.

I am excited, I don't know why, but I feel that I'll be able to experience a lot of things, like drama, friendship, freedom, ... and maybe, falling in love. It's unrelated to what I've been reading in the pamphlet, but who knows? I don't think life is all about being serious, I might finally experience the bittersweet moments I've been longing for, I might even feel something at all.

With that in mind, I take a step towards the gate welcoming me with open arms. The moment I arrived there... something weird happened.

"Ah... My head...!" I writhe out in agony. My vision dims slowly, as the picture my eyes processes distorts into liquid spiralling
around. Everything turned black.
