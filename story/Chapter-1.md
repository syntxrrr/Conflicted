Part 1
The protagonist is said to be the center of the story, the hero, the main character.<br>

The antagonist is said to be the enemy, the one that get's in the way of the hero.<br>

After discovering the messed up truth, I wonder, which one am I...?

It all started... At my house... I was just researching about the projects done in PCBs. You see, I've been getting into microcontrollers and electronics, and applying code to them, as a neat hobby.

I then heard a feminine loud high-pitched voice, a yell "Hello, may I call upon Syne Nomine?"

(... Syne Nomine... Me? I wonder what could that be?)

I looked like a slob back then, but that's because I was. I mean, How could I not be? I was immersed in gazing upon my beloved laptop and our microcontroller kids. At least I took a bath first thing in the morning... Well, enough justification. I stared outside of the window, and saw a woman in a black suit and red tie, you know, the typical businessy type person, probably trying to sell something, that's what I thought back then.

(... But wow, she's rather... beautiful in *their* standards, she has the smile and eyes that could do the talking for her and make anyone believe it without doubt. I would... If I cared)

I changed my clothes and wore my favorite slippers, I went outside and -- well, I always have an impulse whenever I interact with women -- actually with anyone, but of course, it's worse on girls and women -- I, usually having a baritone voice, spoke in a stuttering countertenor voice, as my voice keeps cracking, words come out "Y-y-yes... I-I am Nomi-Syne! Um... w-wait, w-what-do you-"

"Don't worry, may my smile soothe you for now. No need to be anxious." She flashed her smile with her eyes closed, I close my eyes as my face turns red like tomato, trying to hide my uncontrollable smile. These types of girls and women are... scary.

(S-Sorry, but your appeal makes it hard for me to talk to you...!) I gulped and left a smile, damn it.

"Let's get to the point. I am the Lina, the student hunter. I came here on behalf of the University of Existence, to inform you that you've been selected as a student for the First year, class 385th, we've been observing you for a few months, and you've been in your room most of the time, enhancing your well-rounded talents."

"A new student? University of Existence? Observing me??? But that would mean-" I was surprised, started sweating cold bullets. For... many reasons.

"Yeah... Let's not get to that hahaha, there aren't really many guys who could do *that* many times, but let's move on. I see you have your questions, but please feel free to refer to this handbook." She blushed in embarassment, but smiled, throwing the embarassing truth aside.

"About the medium of our observation, it terminated the moment I arrived, so you don't have any evidence to present, when you feel like reporting us. Also... Your CCTV cameras are being altered and your voice recorder could be denied easily." She stuck her tounge against me, like a child.

"Anyway, we need your kind of talent, and you need our kind of resources, right? Let's benefit each other in the way that will better the world! Allow me to be the first to welcome you, as a new student, if ever you hopefully, decided to join us. Well, farewell for now. I'm off to looking for the next student", Ms. Lina said, flashed her smile, and bid her farewell.
