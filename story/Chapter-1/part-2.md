Part 2

Date and Time: August 1, 2016; ? Morning
Place: University of Existence, Gate 1 Entrance

Let's fast forward to my first day as a student of UoE -- as I would like to call it. I am taking a program under Electronics Engineering and Computational Science. These course doesn't have a major -- rather, everything there is treated like one.

I really wasn't suppose to come, even though they promised free tuition and guaranteed that I'll be catered to my needs as long as I provide contribution to the campus. It's suspicious, it's too convenient, and if life ever taught me something in the past, that's there are always misery within happiness, there's a lie in believe. 

But of course, they used my undying love for computers and electronics against me. As the gate opens, the smile that I've been
trying to hide is inevitably showing, I shiver in excitement as I remember the words I read in that damned handbook.

"In order to graduate, a student must submit 4 - 10 contributions to the university and the world, depending on the program they undertook. One contribution in equivalent to one year as a student of UoE, failure to submit a contribution, the university will demand
you to pay a fee equivalent to one year of tuition."

"Students will have their own room consisting of a bathroom, a bedroom, a closet, a portfolio room, and their own laboratory, it's up to the students how the laboratory should look like or should contain, they're free to request for certain facilities, paraphernelia and their own resources that will aid to their contributions".

"The University makes sure its technologies and facilities are state of the art, and lives up to it's name containing anything that could be learned in order to better the humanity and clear the irrational misconceptions over controversial topics."

There are a lot more, but that's not important right now! This must be my dream university! Inside the campus is beautiful, it makes
the university prestigious and novel, the faint smell of flowers and plantations, the serene sleeping animals that roam the university
along with the students. It's like the garden of eden, it's early so there aren't that many people here.

I am excited, I don't know why, but I feel that I'll be able to experience a lot of things, like drama, friendship, freedom, ... and maybe, falling in love. It's unrelated to what I've been reading in the pamphlet, but who knows? I don't think life is all about being serious, I might finally experience the bittersweet moments I've been longing for, I might even feel something at all.

With that in mind, I take a step towards the gate welcoming me with open arms. The moment I arrived there... something weird happened.

"Ah... My head...!" I writhe out in agony. My vision dims slowly, as the picture my eyes processes distorts into liquid spiralling
around. Everything turned black.
